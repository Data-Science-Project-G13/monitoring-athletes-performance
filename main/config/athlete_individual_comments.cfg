[BRIEF_HISTORY]
Andrea_Stranna = July 2018 - Moved to Australia and joined Tri Alliance (best decision ever). Started training consistently for the first time in many years.
                 December 2018 - Start of summer race season and my first triathlon race.
                 January 2019 - Extended Christmas holidays and almost no training for a couple of weeks
                 7-9 June 2019 - First triathlon training camp and proper start of build towards AG Sprint Worlds in end of August.
                 31 August 2019 - AG Sprint Worlds. Definitely the best I have felt in a triathlon so far and felt like following the training program had worked.
