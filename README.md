# monitoring-athletes-performance
A CoachingMate analytical module to generate and deliver personalized feedback to coaches and athletes. Training sessions' descriptions could be 
merged with Garmin data to:
 - assess if athletes are training as they should (is the athlete training as suggested?);
 - assess if athletes are training more or less than what they should (is the athlete over-training?);
 - predict/anticipate athlete risk fatigue levels (to avoid injuries)
 - predict performance (if the athlete keep training in a particular way, how his/her fitness and form levels will increase?
 can this athlete make a podium in a particular event in 6 months time, for example?)
- Look are race performance data to compare predictabilities.
